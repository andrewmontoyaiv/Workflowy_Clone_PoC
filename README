# Workflowy - Proof of Concept

Write lists & organize your life. This is a list-making app that performs in similar function to the popular Workflowy (with many exclusions).
Workflowy Clone is written in Java and uses SQLite to create and store user data. This is a proof of concept, I do not have rights or any affiliation
with the real Workflowy team.

## Note
Within the app, you can use tab & tab+shift to move tasks back and forth in the heirarchy. WRite todos after the bulleted marker. Press enter to
create another task/todo. Backspace on a task to delete the task. This app only works locally.

## TODO
* Functional undo button
* dynamic press on bullets to move tasks around
* Functional remote build
* Implement shortcuts for quick deletion/completion of tasks
